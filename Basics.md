# What is the Main or Original Linux?

👉 The main/original **Linux** is just the **Linux Kernel**, created by **Linus Torvalds in 1991**.

But the Linux operating system you use is usually a **Linux Distribution (distro)** — which includes:
- The Linux kernel
- Software packages
- System utilities
- Package managers

---

## No One “Main” Linux Distro

There is **no one “main” Linux distro** — all are built on the same **Linux kernel** but serve different needs:

### 🔹 Recommended Distros by Use Case:

- **Use Ubuntu / Linux Mint** for general use or beginners  
- **Use RHEL / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux** for enterprise servers  
- **Use Kali Linux** for security testing and ethical hacking  
- **Use Arch Linux** for full control and customization  
- **Use Debian** for ultra-stable and minimal systems
